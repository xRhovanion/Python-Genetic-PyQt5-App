# Python-Genetic-PyQt5-App
A PyQt5-based desktop app for genetic sequence analysis: load FASTA files, view sequences, calculate stats (length, GC), visualize nucleotide frequencies, search motifs (regex/reverse-complement), find ORFs with translation, and detect restriction enzyme sites. Modular design for future bioinformatics extensions.
